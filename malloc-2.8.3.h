/*
 
 This version of malloc.h based on the versions listed below 
 introduces locks based on C++11's <mutex>-facility and tries
 to be more portable accross systems.
 
 This file is part of a project to replace malloc/free by 
 mspace_malloc with shared arenas and reduced lock contention
 in multithreaded programs based on C++11's <thread> specification.

  This header is for ANSI C/C++ only.  You can set any of
  the following #defines before including:

  * If USE_DL_PREFIX is defined, it is assumed that malloc.c 
    was also compiled with this option, so all routines
    have names starting with "dl".

  * If HAVE_USR_INCLUDE_MALLOC_H is defined, it is assumed that this
    file will be #included AFTER <malloc.h>. This is needed only if
    your system defines a struct mallinfo that is incompatible with the
    standard one declared here.  Otherwise, you can include this file
    INSTEAD of your system system <malloc.h>.  At least on ANSI, all
    declarations should be compatible with system versions

  * If MSPACES is defined, declarations for mspace versions are included.

  lock to control access. The capacity of the space will grow
  dynamically as needed to service mspace_malloc requests.  You can
